I am a researcher in the [Diagnostic Image Analysis Group](http://diagnijmegen.nl/) at the Radoud university medical center in Nijmegen, The Netherlands. My research focusses on algorithms for automatic diagnosis in mammography and tomosynthesis.
Before I worked at the Netherlands Cancer Institute and the Delft University of Technology, where I obtained my PhD in mathematics/physics.
